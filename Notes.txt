1. Introduction to JavaScript

JS=JavaScript

What is it?
A high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
*OOP: Object Oriented Programming - based on object for storing most kinds of data

What can JS do?
Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
Build native mobile and desktop applications

Example of applications: React, Angular

JS releases: ES5 --> ES6/ES2015 --> ... --> ES11/ES2020
*ES stands for ECMAScript

2. Linking a JavaScript file

Use console.log to display an output to the browser
for example to display the results of a math calculation in the console of the browser developer tool
e.g. console.log(40+45+50);

If we place <script> </script> inside a html, it is called inline script.
Common practice is to create a separate file for JavaScript and link it to the html file.
Where do we put it? Insert the <script> tag at the end of the <body> tag in the html and include the src.
e.g.   
<body>
  <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1</h1>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>

3. Values and Variables

A variable is like a box where we can put anything inside it.
For example let firstName = "Khairi";
where firstName is the variable and the value assigned to it is "Khairi"

Variable naming convention:
camel Case variable e.g. firstName
variable with underscore e.g. first_name
Illegal when variable starts with a number e.g. 3years 
A variable can consist of numbers, letters, underscores or $ signs

taken from wikipedia: Data types and constructor functions use upper camel case (RegExp, TypeError, XMLHttpRequest, DOMObject) 
and methods use lower camel case (getElementById, getElementsByTagNameNS, createCDATASection).

reserved JS keyword e.g. 'new', 'function', 'name', etc --> will get SyntaxError unexpected token

4. Data Types

A data type is either:
1. An Object
2. A Primitive: 

There are 7 types of Primitive data types:
1.number 2.string 3.boolean 4.undefined 5.null 6.symbol 7.BigInt

- number: floating point numbers, used for decimals and integers e.g. let age = 36;
- string:a sequence of characters, used for text always put in quotes (either single or double) e.g. let firstName = "Ahmad Khairi";
- boolean: logical type either true or false, used when taking/making decisions e.g. let fullAge = true;
- undefined: a value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') e.g. let children;
- null: also means 'empty value' same as undefined
- symbol: value that is unique and cannot be changed, introduced in ES2015
- BigInt: integers which are too big/large than the Number data type can hold, introduced in ES2020
Remark: in JS, data types are automatically defined of a value stored in a variable --> called dynamic typing

operator: typeof
The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. 
e.g. let javaScriptIsFun = true;
console.log(typeof javaScriptIsFun);
--> expected output: boolean

5. let, const and var

let --> values can be re-assigned
const --> values are fixed
var --> not to be used when declaring a variable
